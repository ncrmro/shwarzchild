# Shwarzchild
A portal for your internal services.

Allegory Refrence [Shwarzchild Wormholes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole#Schwarzschild_wormholes)

The idea being you have a physical infrastructure refrenced [here](https://gist.github.com/ncrmro/6b31c77c7828dd3e2b0df2d1a3c355f6).


## Is and is nots
A "portal" into your infrastructure. This should depending on a users role and permissions show a list of services and other diagnostic information. 

Eg this should interface with an existing infrastructure, it would simply be set of clients.

Initially this project should have fake data as the existing infrastructure is not currently.


## Design Methodology
As this is the first service in what amounts to infrastructure spanning various protocols and services some services initially designed here should be thought as eventually becoming their own repositories.

* oAUTH/Hydra
* LDAP
* Node
* Postgres
* React Native
* D3

## Orgins of Name

Schwarzschild wormholes, also known as Einsteinâ€“Rosen bridges (named after Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen), are connections between areas of space..

If plotted on a 2-dimensional plane, the wormhole bends the plane, like folding a paper, so that the two ends would be touching.

Although Schwarzschild wormholes are not traversable in both directions, their existence inspired Kip Thorne to imagine traversable wormholes created by holding the "throat" of a Schwarzschild wormhole open with exotic matter (material that has negative mass/energy).
